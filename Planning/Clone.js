First : "Like branches on a tree, our lives may grow in different directions 
	 yet our roots remain as one.",
Second : "Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. <br>
	 Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. - Jane Howard",
Third : "Time is mapped with laughter and cheers, <br>
the long road sometimes landmarked with sadness and tears.<br>

Elders pass and children grow,<br>
has it been that long we ask, where does the time go?<br>

Not every chance to gather is taken.<br>
"We'll see them next time" we say and hope we're not mistaken.<br>

A chance like now comes once in a lifetime it seems,<br>
when the bright light of family is nurtured and beams,<br>
there will be laughter and time to reminisce<br>
we will all be proud this is a chance we did not miss.- Ryan Guerrero <br>" };
