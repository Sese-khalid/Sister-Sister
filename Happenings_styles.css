PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative

partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as 
long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can 
be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved 
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under 
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply 
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
